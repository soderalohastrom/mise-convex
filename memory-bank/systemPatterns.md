# System Patterns

## Architecture
- Modular scripts for database, data, and deployment management
- Convex backend for real-time data and business logic
- Documentation-driven development

## Key Technical Decisions
- Use of Convex for backend and data storage
- Node.js scripts for automation
- JSON for data export/import
- Environment-based deployment (prod, staging)

## Design Patterns
- Separation of concerns: scripts, schema, and docs are modular
- Validation and test data generation are automated
- Documentation and onboarding are first-class citizens
